<Update Logs> 

[9/21] 
Created and set up Git for learning Ruby on rails. Git repo is acting weird with errors. possible indexing issue. Createing logs to test pushs to repo. 

Was able to correct the indexing issues by removing the old indexes and pruning the repos. 

Created the Ruby_Programing dir. This will house all ruby programing in files that will be copied into real runtime webapps during this phase of the course. 

programing will be done in vscode and copies int repl.it 
each file will represent a secition of the course.
